Our model is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),
specially designed to capture sequential patterns in stock volatility and trading volume over time.

st.markdown("""
- **Financial Database** (Price, Volume, Financial Statement and Earnings Announcements Data from WRDS)
- **Macroeconomic Indicators** (GDP, CPI, Unemployment Rate etc. from FRED)
- **New** (Breaking Newa Related to Companies, Sentiment Analysis through FINBERT)

st.header("6. Limitations & Considerations")
st.warning("""
-The model shows limited predictive accuracy due to suboptimal feature selection, particularly missing key drivers of trading volume.

-Important factors influencing volume changes, such as intraday news flow, investor sentiment, or institutional activity, are not adequately captured.

-The model may underperform on stocks where volume is driven by context-specific factors not reflected in the input features
